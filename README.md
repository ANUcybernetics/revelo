# Revelo

**Revelo** is a tool for better understanding the social, technical and
environmental systems you care about and participate in, and for finding the
hidden feedback loops which drive the system's behaviour.

This isn't a hands-off "computer, tell me the answer" thing---it's a tool for
having meaningful conversations (and disagreements) about the difference between
how things are _supposed_ to work and how things _actually_ work.
