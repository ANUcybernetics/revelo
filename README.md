# Revelo

**Revelo** is a tool for better understanding the social, technical and
environmental systems you care about and participate in, and for finding the
hidden feedback loops which drive the system's behaviour.

This isn't a hands-off "computer, tell me the answer" thing---it's a tool for
having meaningful conversations (and disagreements) about the difference between
how things are _supposed_ to work and how things _actually_ work.

## Potential Taglines

- Systems thinking beyond charlatanry
- Everyone agrees the system's cooked. Argue better about _why_.
- Find loops. Argue with colleagues.
- Systems mapping for the people (or "for the rest of us")
- The worst interface for systems mapping, except for all the other ones we've
  tried
