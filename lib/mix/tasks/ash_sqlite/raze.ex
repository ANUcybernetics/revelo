defmodule Mix.Tasks.AshSqlite.Raze do
  @moduledoc """
  Delete all (ash_sqlite-generated) migrations and resource snapshots

  This is useful for early development when the resources are changing
  a lot, especially in ways that make auto-generated migrations tricky/impossible.

  The general workflow is

  1. use this (`mix ash_sqlite.raze`) to delete all the migrations and resource_snapshots in the app
  2. mix ecto.reset
  3. start again with a new `mix ash_sqlite.generate_migrations`

  If you want a one-liner, try:

  ```
  mix ash_sqlite.raze && rm revelo_*db* && mix ash_sqlite.generate_migrations --name initial_migration && mix setup
  ```

  Note: `@snapshot_path` and `@migrations_path` are currently hardcoded to their default values. If you
  use different values (via arguments to `ash_sqlite.generate_migrations`) then you'll want to edit the values.
