# TODO

This is a bit lighter-weight than using GH issues, and will do for now (while
we're building it out & exploring the problem space).

## Libraries we'll use

- Phoenix LiveView (for web stuff)
- Ash & AshPhoenix (for data modelling)
- StreamData for property-based testing
- SaladUI
- PhoenixTest (and hopefully PhoenixTestPlaywright) for front-end testing
- mermaid.js (in a phoenix hook) for rendering the diagrams
- AshAuthentication (with passwords, maybe even magic links?) for auth
- [InstructorLite](https://hexdocs.pm/instructor_lite/readme.html) for
  platform-agnostic API use
